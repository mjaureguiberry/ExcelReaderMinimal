# ExcelReaderMinimal
This code is based on Spout, a PHP library to read and write spreadsheet files (CSV, XLSX and ODS). But it only contains the minimal classes and methods needed to read a spreadsheet.

For reference, the complete Spout library can be found at at [https://github.com/box/spout](https://github.com/box/spout).

## Requirements

* PHP version 7.2 or higher
* PHP extension `php_zip` enabled
* PHP extension `php_xmlreader` enabled

Tested on CentOS 7.9 with PHP 7.2.34
